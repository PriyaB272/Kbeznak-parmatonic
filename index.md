The story of Kbeznak Parmatonic:

The term/phrase Kbeznak Parmatonic is going to be mentioned by hundreds of webpages in the next one week. (Yes. I can foresee the future. Skills!). Kbeznak parmatonic is a term that was coined on February 16, 2018 by Dr. James Caverlee, professor in Computer Science and Engineering department of Texas A&M University. He is a visiting scientist in Google as well. (Cool, isn't it?)



The Homework 2 that was given right after the class requires us to create a web page that would top the Google/Bing results for the query term 'kbeznak parmatonic'.



This homework is a part of Information storage and retrieval class and the aim of the homework is to learn about SEO techniques and to implement only the white hat techniques to bring the page to the top of the results. Well. It is interesting I must say. So as mentioned earlier there are going to be hundreds of pages talking about the kbeznak parmatonic (because we are 100 students in the class).
